        "Imbalanced datasets can lead machine learning models to be biased toward the majority class, affecting their ability to generalize to minority classes.\n",
        "SMOTE is effective in overcoming this issue by increasing the representation of the minority class, thus improving model performance on minority class instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Before Balancing:**\n",
        "The class distribution before balancing was imbalanced, with Class 0 having significantly more instances than Class 1 and Class 2.\n",

        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of SMOTE in this scenario is justified when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it helps create a more representative training set by introducing synthetic instances of the minority class. This balanced dataset is then suitable for training machine learning models that can make more accurate predictions on all classes."
